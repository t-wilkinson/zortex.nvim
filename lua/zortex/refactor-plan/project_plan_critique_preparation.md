## Project Plan Critique & Preparation

Before diving into specific suggestions, it would be helpful to:

1. **See the detailed plan itself**  
   Paste your project plan here (goals, milestones, timeline, deliverables, etc.) so I can comment on its clarity, scope, and feasibility.

2. **Review key code modules**  
   To ground my feedback in the existing implementation, consider sharing any of these files if they relate to your plan:
   - `parser.lua` (core parsing logic)  
   - `tasks.lua` (task conversion, toggle flow)  
   - `progress.lua` (overall progress orchestration)  
   - `projects.lua` & `areas.lua` (XP management, hierarchy)  
   - `base.lua` & `xp.lua` (data persistence, default state)

3. **Upload additional artifacts**  
   If you have a README, design document, diagram, or roadmap, please include those too.

Once I have the plan details (and any relevant files), I can:
- Assess overall structure and timeline
- Identify missing milestones or dependencies
- Suggest refinements to code architecture and module boundaries
- Highlight opportunities for testing, documentation, and maintenance
- Point out potential performance or scalability concerns

Feel free to paste or link the plan and any files here when ready!
