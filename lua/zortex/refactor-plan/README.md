# Zortex - A Gamified Personal Knowledge & Task Management System for Neovim

## Overview

Zortex is a comprehensive personal productivity system built as a Neovim plugin that combines task management, note-taking, project tracking, and knowledge organization with gamification elements. It uses a custom markup format (`.zortex` files) to create an interconnected system where completing tasks earns experience points, projects track progress automatically, and your knowledge base grows organically.

Think of it as a fusion of:

- **GTD (Getting Things Done)** methodology with areas, projects, and tasks
- **OKR (Objectives and Key Results)** for goal setting and tracking
- **Zettelkasten** for knowledge management with bidirectional links
- **RPG elements** with XP, levels, and skill trees for motivation

## Core Concepts

### 1. **Hierarchical Organization**

- **Areas**: High-level life domains (e.g., "Work/Engineering", "Personal/Health")
- **Projects**: Concrete initiatives with defined outcomes
- **Tasks**: Actionable items that can be completed
- **Objectives**: Time-bound goals with measurable key results

### 2. **Custom Markup Language**

```zortex
@@Article Title
@tag1

# Project Name @done(2024-01-20) @progress(5/10)
Links: [Areas/Work/Engineering]

## Subproject

- [ ] Task description @id(abc123) @due(2024-02-01) @p1
- [x] Completed task @done(2024-01-15)

**Bold Heading**:
Content under bold heading

Label:
Content with label formatting
```

### 3. **Experience & Progression System**

- Tasks award XP based on size, priority, and time horizon
- Areas accumulate XP and level up independently
- Seasonal progression with battle pass-style tiers
- Skill tree visualization of your expertise

- **Level Progression**: Areas level up based on accumulated XP
- **Seasonal Challenges**: Time-bound progression with tier rewards
- **Skill Tree**: Visualize your expertise across different areas
- **Achievement Tracking**: See your progress over time

### üîî Notification System

- **Multi-provider Support**: System notifications, email, push notifications
- **Pomodoro Timer**: Built-in work/break cycle management
- **Custom Timers**: Set reminders for any duration
- **Calendar Sync**: Get notified about upcoming events
- **Daily Digest**: Email summary of tasks and events

### üé® Rich UI Components

- **Calendar View**: Interactive calendar with emoji indicators
- **Search Interface**: Telescope-based search with preview
- **Skill Tree Display**: Visual representation of area expertise
- **Progress Bars**: ASCII progress indicators throughout
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Custom highlighting with concealment

## File Structure

### Special Files

- `projects.zortex` - Active projects and tasks
- `areas.zortex` - Area hierarchy definition
- `okr.zortex` - Objectives and key results
- `calendar.zortex` - Calendar entries and events
- `z/archive.projects.zortex` - Archived projects
- `.z/` - System data (state files, logs)

### Markup Elements

- `@@Title` - Article/document title
- `@tag` - Tags for categorization
- `# Heading` - Hierarchical sections (up to 6 levels)
- `**Bold**:` - Bold headings (alternative to # syntax)
- `Label:` - Label sections
- `- [ ] Task` - Task with checkbox
- `[Link]` - Internal link
- `@attr(value)` - Attributes for tasks/projects

## Technical Architecture

### Modular Design

- **Core**: Parser, filesystem, datetime, buffer operations
- **Features**: Calendar, links, highlights, completion
- **Models**: Task and calendar entry objects
- **Modules**: Business logic for areas, projects, tasks
- **Stores**: Data persistence layer
- **UI**: User interface components
- **XP**: Gamification subsystem
- **Notifications**: Pluggable notification providers

### Key Differentiators

1. **Unified System**: Everything interconnected rather than separate tools
2. **File-based**: All data in plain text for version control and longevity
3. **Keyboard-driven**: Optimized for Vim workflows
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple to start, powerful when needed
5. **Motivational**: Gamification that respects your time and goals

## Use Cases

- **Software Engineers**: Track projects, learn new technologies, manage technical debt
- **Students**: Organize coursework, track learning progress, manage deadlines
- **Freelancers**: Project management, time tracking, client organization
- **Researchers**: Knowledge management, literature notes, experiment tracking
- **Personal Development**: Habit tracking, goal setting, life management

## Philosophy

Zortex is built on the belief that:

- Your productivity system should motivate, not overwhelm
- Progress should be visible and celebrated
- Knowledge compounds when properly connected
- Tools should adapt to your workflow, not vice versa
- Gamification can make mundane tasks engaging without being manipulative

The plugin aims to be a "second brain" that not only stores information but actively helps you develop expertise and achieve your goals through intelligent tracking and motivational mechanics.
